What is V8 engine?

    The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google
    It's written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome and Node.js
    It compiles JavaScript code directly into machine code before executing it, making JavaScript execution very fast
    It handles memory allocation, garbage collection, and provides the data types, operators, objects, and functions of JavaScript


What is a package?

    A package is a collection of code modules, configuration files, and resources
    It contains all files needed for a module to work properly
    Usually includes a package.json file that describes the package
    Can be published to and installed from npm (Node Package Manager)
    May include dependencies on other packages
    What is a module?
    A module is a reusable block of code that encapsulates related code
    It can be a single file or a directory with a package.json file
    Can be built-in (like 'fs', 'http') or external (installed via npm)
    Uses require() or import to be included in other files
    Helps in organizing code and maintaining separation of concerns


What is npm?

    npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js
    World's largest software registry with over 1 million packages
    Used to install, share, and manage dependencies in Node.js projects
    Provides command-line tools for package management
    Manages the package.json file which tracks project dependencies
    Provides a global installation of npm packages
    Used to install and manage global packages
    Used to install and manage local packages

why use v8 engine or not use other engines?

    Why use V8 engine:

    Performance
    Highly optimized JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation
    Advanced optimization techniques like inline caching
    Efficient memory management with precise garbage collection
    Fast startup time and runtime performance
    Community & Support
    Backed by Google with regular updates and improvements
    Large developer community
    Well-documented and extensively tested
    Production-proven in Chrome and Node.js
    Features
    Supports latest ECMAScript standards
    Excellent debugging capabilities
    Built-in tools for profiling and optimization
    Cross-platform compatibility
    Other JavaScript Engines and Why They Might Not Be Preferred:

    SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
    Primarily designed for browser use
    Less optimized for server-side applications
    Smaller community for server-side development
    More focused on Firefox-specific optimizations
    JavaScriptCore (Safari/WebKit)
    More tightly coupled with Apple's ecosystem
    Less optimization for server-side scenarios
    Smaller community compared to V8
    Limited tools for server-side development
    Chakra (Internet Explorer/Edge - Legacy)
    Microsoft has moved to V8 for Edge
    Limited modern feature support
    Smaller ecosystem
    Less active development
    Nashorn (Java)
    Deprecated in newer Java versions
    Slower performance compared to V8
    Limited modern JavaScript feature support
    Requires Java runtime
    V8 is preferred because it:

    Offers the best balance of performance and features
    Has proven reliability in production environments
    Maintains active development and community support
    Provides excellent tools for debugging and optimization
    Has seamless integration with Node.js ecosystem
    This is why Node.js chose V8 as its engine, and why it remains the preferred choice for server-side JavaScript execution.
